Hi! I'm AlaskanBlueJay (just Jay for short). I've been self-teaching programming for a litle over a year (since May 2022)
- I'm intermediately experienced in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- I'm self-motivated, a hard worker, and a fast learner, and am very comfortable figuring out and overcoming problems on my own
  - (8 months of my last year of study were spent living out of hostels and airbnbs in Europe completely on my own, which did a lot for my self-reliance)
- Most of my expereince so far is in web development and some basic Python scripting, but I'd love to branch out into some machine learning soon too if I can, AI absolutely fascinates me!
- I'd be interested in collaborating on pretty much anything for now. Programming is such a wide and interesting world, and I want to sample the entire buffet!
- I can be reached on discord @AlaskanBlueJay or by email at codingcaffeind@gmail.com (discord is the safer bet if you want to get in contact with me fast, I don't check email super often)
