Hi! I'm Jay. I've been self-teaching programming since Fall of 2022.
- I'm intermediately experienced in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- I'm self-motivated, a hard worker, and a fast learner, and am very comfortable figuring out and overcoming problems on my own
  - (8 months of my 2023 were spent living out of hostels and airbnbs in Europe completely on my own, which did a lot for my self-reliance)
- Most of my expereince so far is in web development and some basic Python scripting, but I'd love to branch out into some machine learning soon too if I can, AI absolutely fascinates me!
- I'd be interested in collaborating on pretty much anything for now. Programming is such a wide and interesting world, and I'm always starving for something new to learn.
- I can be reached at selfwareengineer@gmail.com
